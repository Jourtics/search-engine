Given a polygon, your task is to calculate the number of lattice points inside the polygon and on its boundary. A lattice point is a point whose coordinates are integers.

The polygon consists of n vertices (x1,y1),(x2,y2), ,(xn,yn). The vertices (xi,yi) and (xi+1,yi+1) are adjacent for i=1,2, ,n 1, and the vertices (x1,y1) and (xn,yn) are also adjacent.

Input

The first input line has an integer n: the number of vertices.

After this, there are n lines that describe the vertices. The ith such line has two integers xi and yi.

You may assume that the polygon is simple, i.e., it does not intersect itself.

Output

Print two integers: the number of lattice points inside the polygon and on its boundary.

Constraints

3<=n<=10^5
 10^6<=xi,yi<=10^6
