Your task is to maintain a list of arrays which initially has a single array. You have to process the following types of queries:
Set the value a in array k to x.
Calculate the sum of values in range [a,b] in array k.
Create a copy of array k and add it to the end of the list.

Input

The first input line has two integers n and q: the array size and the number of queries.

The next line has n integers t1,t2, ,tn: the initial contents of the array.

Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. The format of each line is one of the following: "1 k a x", "2 k a b" or "3 k".

Output

Print the answer to each sum query.

Constraints

 1<=n,q<=2 10^5
 1<=ti,x<=10^9
 1<=a<=b<=n

Example

Input:
5 6
