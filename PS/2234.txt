An array has n integers x1,x2, ,xn, and each of them has been randomly chosen between 1 and ri. An inversion is a pair (a,b) where a<b and xa>xb.

What is the expected number of inversions in the array?

Input

The first input line contains an integer n: the size of the array.

The second line contains n integers r1,r2, ,rn: the range of possible values for each array position.

Output

Print the expected number of inversions rounded to six decimal places.

Constraints

1<=n<=100
1<=ri<=100

Example

Input:
3
5 2 7

Output:
