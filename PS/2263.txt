Given a set of points in the two-dimensional plane, your task is to find the minimum Euclidean distance between two distinct points.

The Euclidean distance of points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is (x1 x2)2+(y1 y2)2.

Input

The first input line has an integer n: the number of points.

After this, there are n lines that describe the points. Each line has two integers x and y. You may assume that each point is distinct.

Output

Print one integer: d2 where d is the minimum Euclidean distance (this ensures that the result is an integer).

Constraints

2<=n<=2 10^5
 10^9<=x,y<=10^9

Example

Input:
