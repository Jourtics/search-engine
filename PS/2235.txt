Consider a game where two players remove sticks from a heap. The players move alternately, and the player who removes the last stick wins the game.

A set P={p1,p2, ,pk} determines the allowed moves. For example, if P={1,3,4}, a player may remove 1, 3 or 4 sticks.

Your task is find out for each number of sticks 1,2, ,n if the first player has a winning or losing position.

Input

The first input line has two integers n and k: the number of sticks and moves.

The next line has k integers p1,p2, ,pk that describe the allowed moves. All integers are distinct, and one of them is 1.

Output

Print a string containing n characters: W means a winning position, and L means a losing position.

Constraints

1<=n<=10^6
1<=k<=100
1<=pi<=n
