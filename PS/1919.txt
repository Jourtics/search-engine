Given a string S find all possible subsequences of the string in lexicographically-sorted order.
Example 1:
Input : str = "abc"
Output: a ab abc ac b bc c
Explanation : There are 7 subsequences that 
can be formed from abc.

Example 2:
Input: str = "aa"
Output: a a aa
Explanation : There are 3 subsequences that 
can be formed from aa.

Your Task:
You don't need to read ot print anything. Your task is to complete the function AllPossibleStrings() which takes S as input parameter and returns a list of all possible substrings(non-empty) that can be formed from S in lexicographically-sorted order.
 
Expected Time Complexity: O(2^n) where n is the length of the string
Expected Space Complexity : O(n * 2^n)
 
Constraints: 
1 <= Length of string <= 16
