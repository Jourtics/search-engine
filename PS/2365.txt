Given an n m grid and two squares a=(y1,x1) and b=(y2,x2), create a path from a to b that visits each square exactly once.

For example, here is a path from a=(1,3) to b=(3,6) in a 4 7 grid:

Input

The first input line has an integer t: the number of tests.

After this, there are t lines that describe the tests. Each line has six integers n, m, y1, x1, y2 and x2.

In all tests 1<=y1,y2<=n ja 1<=x1,x2<=m. In addition, y1 y2 or x1 x2.

Output

Print YES, if it is possible to construct a path, and NO otherwise.

If there is a path, also print its description which consists of characters U (up), D (down), L (left) ja R (right). If there are several paths, you can print any of them.

Constraints

1<=t<=100
1<=n<=50
1<=m<=50
