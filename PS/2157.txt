You are playing a game consisting of n planets. Each planet has a teleporter to another planet (or the planet itself).

Your task is to process q queries of the form: when you begin on planet x and travel through k teleporters, which planet will you reach?

Input

The first input line has two integers n and q: the number of planets and queries. The planets are numbered 1,2, ,n.

The second line has n integers t1,t2, ,tn: for each planet, the destination of the teleporter. It is possible that ti=i.

Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. Each line has two integers x and k: you start on planet x and travel through k teleporters.

Output

Print the answer to each query.

Constraints

1<=n,q<=2 10^5
1<=ti<=n
1<=x<=n
0<=k<=10^9
