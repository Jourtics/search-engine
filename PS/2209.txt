Given a tree of n nodes, your task is to count the number of distinct paths that have at least k1 and at most k2 edges.

Input

The first input line contains three integers n, k1 and k2: the number of nodes and the path lengths. The nodes are numbered 1,2, ,n.

Then there are n 1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b.

Output

Print one integer: the number of paths.

Constraints

1<=k1<=k2<=n<=2 10^5
1<=a,b<=n
