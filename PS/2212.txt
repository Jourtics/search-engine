Your task is to efficiently calculate values a^(b^c) modulo 10^9+7.

Note that in this task we assume that 0^0=1.

Input

The first input line has an integer n: the number of calculations.

Afther this, there are n lines, each containing three integers a, b and c.

Output

Print each value abc modulo 10^9+7.

Constraints

1<=n<=10^5
0<=a,b,c<=10^9
